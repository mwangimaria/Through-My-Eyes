        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My art journey is shaped by curiosity, courage, and a kind heart that guides how I see the world. I’m an adventurous and thrill-seeking individual who’s always exploring new ideas, whether through painting, digital art, or capturing moments through my camera. Photography teaches me to appreciate the little thigs that go unseen, they are the kind of moments that weave their way into my artwork. My mum is my greatest inspiration, her strength, creativity, and love have shaped the way I express myself and the confidence I bring into my work. My humour and warmth naturally show up in the way that I carry myself, giving my art a playful yet thoughtful touch. As I grow, I keep experimenting and refining my voice and letting my art and photography evolve. Everything I create reflects where I’ve been, what I’ve learned, and the excitement I feel for what’s still ahead.</p>
